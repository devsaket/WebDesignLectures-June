        </ul>

        <p><u><b>HyperText:</b></u> HyperText simply means <i>"Reference Text contained by a Text"</i>. A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other. </p>
